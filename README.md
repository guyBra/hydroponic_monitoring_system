## Description

The Hydroponic Monitoring System is a project aimed at creating an automated monitoring and control system for hydroponic setups. This system focuses on measuring and regulating two critical parameters: Electrical Conductivity (EC) and pH levels in the nutrient solution.

Hydroponics is a soilless cultivation method that relies on a nutrient-rich water solution to grow plants. Maintaining optimal EC and pH levels is essential for the health and productivity of the plants. This monitoring system will enable growers to track these parameters in real-time and make necessary adjustments to ensure optimal growing conditions.

The system utilizes sensors and microcontrollers to gather data from the hydroponic setup, which is then processed and displayed on a user interface. Additionally, it offers the functionality to automate nutrient dosing and pH adjustment processes based on the collected data.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of Electrical Conductivity (EC) and pH levels in the hydroponic system.
- Data visualization and analysis to track trends and make informed decisions.
- Automated nutrient dosing and pH adjustment based on the measured values.
- Alert notifications for critical parameter deviations.
- User-friendly interface for system control and configuration.
